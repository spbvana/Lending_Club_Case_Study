# Lending Club Case Study

Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace specializing in offering a variety of loans to urban customers, faces a critical challenge in managing its loan approval process. When evaluating loan applications, the company must make sound decisions to minimize financial losses, primarily stemming from loans extended to applicants who are considered "risky."

These financial losses, referred to as credit losses, occur when borrowers fail to repay their loans or default. In simpler terms, borrowers labeled as "charged-off" are the ones responsible for the most significant losses to the company.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

1. Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
2. On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.

## Objectives

The objective is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this goal through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided [dataset](./loan.csv).

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## EDA Approach Steps

- Data Understanding-
Understanding and working with data dictionary and getting good knowledge of all the columns and their domain specific uses.

- Data Cleaning-
Removing null valued columns, single uniques columns, unnecessary columns then manipulation of data such as conversion of data types, removing outliers, deriving new variables and many more.

- Univariate Analysis-
Analysing each columns and plotting the distribution of each to get more information.

- Segmented Univariate Analysis-
To get more insight of single data variables in the form of segments.

- Bivariate Analysis-
Through this we can analyse two variables and determine empirical relationship between them.

- Conclusions-
Atlast we can conclude what all variables to be considered by the Lending Club while approving the loan so that loss of the company can be reduced.
